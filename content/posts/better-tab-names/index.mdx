I've been working on NextJS code bases a lot, and one thing that has been annoying for me is that many files have the same name.

You'll be seeing a lot of `page.tsx` files open as tabs. Luckily theres a quick and easy fix if you are using VSCode (I'm sure that your favorite editor can do the same thing, so look it up.)

Heres a NextJS example, just add it to your `.vscode/settings.json` file.

```json
"workbench.editor.customLabels.patterns": {
	"**/app/**/index.ts": "${dirname} <index.ts>",
	"**/app/**/page.tsx": "${dirname} <page.tsx>",
	"**/app/**/layout.tsx": "${dirname} <layout.tsx>",
	"**/app/**/route.ts": "${dirname} <route.tsx>"
}
```

Hope this helps you, enjoy!
