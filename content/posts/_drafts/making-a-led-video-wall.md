Linsn RV901

The wiring is pretty simple.

However the documentation and software is a pure nightmare made of the stuff that haunts you forever.
We bought the modules from adafruit, they had most things needed for building this project.

## The mythical test function
In the manual it's descriped as follows:

> 25. Test Function
> Receiving card has the test function, no sending card needed; can test the display directly, such as bias,
> gray level, red, green, blue, etc. many kinds of test modes.

This seems great right!? Yeah, but that's about it... I have no idea how to use this mode. It would be pretty handy however.
