This is part one. We will discuss what we need build tools for, and what it can do for us.

## What's the point?
In modern web-development we need to do more and more things.
You have to optimize everything, and if you are working in big teams you need to write consistent code, and maybe some unit test.

Let's start be identifying our needs.


- Optimize assets
- Compiling


### Optimizations of assets:
	- Images/Vectors
	- JavaScript
	- CSS

### Compiling
Using things like LESS or SASS is a really great way to improve your CSS. It gives you a lot of powerfull features, that you don't have in CSS.

If you have to do this each time you want to deploy it quickly gets to the point where writing a script saves you a lot of time.
Writing a script will save you from human errors. It will make you do the fun things, and not the boring repetitive things. It will save you money.
