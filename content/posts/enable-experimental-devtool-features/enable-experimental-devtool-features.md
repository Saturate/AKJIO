Want to check out the latest features of your DevTools? If you are feeling adventurous do the following:

1. Browse to `chrome://flags/#enable-devtools-experiments`
2. Click "Enable" for the "Developer Tools experiment" feature.
3. Restart / Relunch Chrome
4. Open DevTools again (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+L)
5. Click the Kebab/Thee dots icon (F1)
6. Click the newly added "Experiments" tabs
7. Enable the features you want.

It's possible that these features can make your browser buggy.
But they can also help you great deal, I used the animation tools long before they were released and that helped me a lot.

And that's not all, they have even more hidden features that you can view if you press Shift 6 times in a row.
Yep, that's a bit strange but there they are, even more features - but I suspect that these are even more buggy.
