# Hi & welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Allan Kimmer Jensen**, a software engineer and consultant with over 15 years of professional experience.
I also hold a qualification in media graphic design, which has given me a broader perspective on how to balance aesthetics with functionality.

This space is my personal digital garden. You may notice it isnâ€™t as polished or frequently updated as Iâ€™d like.

Most of my time goes into developing and refining digital solutions for clients, and that leaves little room to nurture my own projects.

Still, I often jot down new ideas or improvements that I want to implement here.
These ideas range from interactive design concepts to long-term software explorations. Unfortunately, priorities elsewhere mean some of these thoughts sit on the shelf for quite a while.

I continue striving to find moments to bring these plans to life, though.

Perhaps the collection of notes here will spark something new when the time is right.

Meanwhile, I hope you enjoy exploring the small pieces of work Iâ€™ve managed to place in this evolving corner of the online world.

With lots of â™¥, Allan.
