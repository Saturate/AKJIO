# Stuff I Use

This is a collection of what I use. I'm not sure why I like the idea, but I do so here it is.

I'm using all the operating systems, MacOS, Windows and Linux. So some of these might now apply to all OSs.

## Software

- [Signal](https://signal.org), the best messaging platform IMO, even my mom uses it.
- [Cmder](https://cmder.app/), the windows command line is bad - this makes it better.

## Photoghrapy

I have a Nikon D610, I like this camera but want to upgrade when they release something new as I could use some more features like GPS and better video. My other gear includes:

- MindShift Backlight 26L
- Lee Big Stopper
- Lee Little Stopper
- Nikon Flash
