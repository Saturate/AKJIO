# About

I'm Allan Kimmer Jensen, currently Lead Solution Architect at NORRIQ, where I design and deliver complex systems across domains. I also run my own consultancy, Remmik ApS, where I take on select freelance projects.

## What I Do

With 15+ years of experience and 200+ client projects under my belt, I've worked across a wide range of domains:

- **High-stakes systems**: Election infrastructure, compliance platforms
- **Frontend engineering**: Modern web applications, design systems
- **Security**: Pentesting, vulnerability assessments, CTF competitions
- **DevOps/DX**: Developer experience, tooling, CI/CD pipelines
- **Solution architecture**: Translating business needs into technical reality

I hold a qualification in media graphic design, which influences how I approach building software—always balancing functionality with usability.

## Background

I started in media design, moved into full-stack development, and over time specialized in security and architecture. One of my proudest projects: designing and delivering the stage and information system for DR during a Danish national election—high stakes, high visibility, zero room for error.

## Current Focus

These days I'm focused on:
- Secure system design
- Product architecture that people actually enjoy using
- Red team practice (regular CTF participation)
- Developer tooling and workflow optimization

## Speaking

I've spoken at various events:

Outside of work, you'll probably find me hiking somewhere quiet and green.
