# Stuff I Use

This is a collection of what I use. I'm not sure why I like the idea, but I do so here it is.

## Web Development

-   Cmder, the windows command line is bad - this makes it better.
-   Atom, my primary editor

## Photoghrapy

I have a Nikon D610, I like this camera but want to upgrade when they release something new as I could use some more features like GPS and better video. My other gear includes:

-   MindShift Backlight 26L
-   Lee Big Stopper
-   Lee Little Stopper
-   Nikon Flash
