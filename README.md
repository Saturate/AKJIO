## History

### v1 - gulp-water
Home made plugin for gulp.js that took md files and rendered them. Fully static generated site.

### v2 - GatsbyJS
Tried implementing the blog in GatsbyJS, as I wanted to get away from gulp and input more used tooling for the frontend. But never really felt that nice, so ended up not doing it.

### v3 - NextJS
Funnily enough this feels like v1 still, but just in the NextJS framework. MDX is pretty cool as it'll allow me to make some interactive guides and blogposts easily. However I think this is unrealistic, as I don't spend that much time on this project - but hey, now I can.
