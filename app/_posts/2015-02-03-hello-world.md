Hello World!  

This is my new blog that I have had intentions of making the last many years. A wise man once said

> ‘Finished last’ will always be better than ‘Did not finish’, which always trumps ‘Did not start.’

I've made lots of websites before, small and big in my work as a consultant.
But my own never really got out of the drawing board and sketches. Each time I tired I stopped somewhere in the process.

I installed WordPress, MySQL, PHP and well then never got any father than that.
I made a design in Photoshop. Never looked at that again.

So that's why it's now a great pleasure of mine to say welcome to my very own personal website. Keep on reading if you want the details.

## But, why even make a blog?

Well, it seems a little like JavaScript frameworks. Everybody and their dog's has one of their own.

I intend to make my blog a little different. I want to update each article when the time is fit, little more like a wiki than a blog. Of course I realize that this can be hard, and therefore I also open sourced my blog. It's all on GitHub and people are free to make pull-requests to update add/or missing information.

### But that does not really answer my question...

Okay I want a place to document my front-end findings, while I practice the **art** of writing.
All feedback and blog ideas are welcome.

## How is it made?

It's made using Gulp, NodeJS and Metalsmith. All hosted on GitHub.

All posts and pages are just plain markdown files that gets converted to HTML on build time. This is also called a static generated site, you can do it with Jekyll. I really like Jekyll, and took a lot of their ideas but did it all in JavaScript with Metalsmith. Why metalsmith and not something else? Well there are thousand things that could do this, I just picked one that fitted my needs.

I'll cover the pros and cons of a static generated site in a later post. And update this post


## Whats going to happen now?

I'll continue to work on the site, make a design and implement some nice but missing features.
