Hello World!  

This is my new blog that I have had intentions of making the last many years. A wise man once said

> ‘Finished last’ will always be better than ‘Did not finish’, which always trumps ‘Did not start.’

I've made lots of websites before, small and big in my work as a consultant.
But my own never really got of a life, and each time I tired I stopped somewhere in the process.

It's a pleasure to say welcome to my very own personal website.
