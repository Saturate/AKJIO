# Labs

<p>Nothing here, yet!</p>

<p>In the future I'll put all my strange tools or links to tools here.</p>

Right now I need to finish this site. It looks like ~~crap~~.

## NemTerminal
A plugin for NemID. Now you can login the cool way!

## SongPopper
A Chrome extension. It intercepts data requests and display's the correct awnser to the user, makes it really easy to win.
They should really improve on how they handle their data.

## LikeJacker
It's a jQuery plugin for LikeJacking Facebook pages.
I know it's evil but it was so easy to do.
I recommend https://disconnect.me/ to avoid the annoying like buttons on all pages.
